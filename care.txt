I thought caring is what makes person a truly good person.
I wasn't good, in my opinion, because I didn't cared about anyone, not my friends, not even family.
In my childhood I had two grandmas, one lived in the next apartment from my parents'.
She visited us quite often. I was 5 or 6 at the time, she tried to play with me, interact with me, talk. But I always rejected her.
I rejected her, even though I was 6 and I absolutely didn't understood what's good and what's not, what's feelings,
I still made her feel bad. Now I feel bad for making her feel bad.
Years has passed.
More than 10.
She isn't alive for a lot of time now.
For about.. 9 years?
I changed.
I started caring, but life decided to play it out on me.
And now I am in her position.
